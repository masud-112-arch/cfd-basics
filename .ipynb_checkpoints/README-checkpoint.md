# ðŸŒ€ CFD-Basics

A collection of simple, educational Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations implemented in Python.  
Each notebook introduces a classical CFD problem with clear theory, code, and visualization.  

These are meant as learning projects and portfolio material, covering the path from simple flows to more advanced CFD ideas.
